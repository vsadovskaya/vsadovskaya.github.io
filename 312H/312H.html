&nbsp &nbsp   <b>Course description:</b>&nbsp; <br> 
&nbsp &nbsp This course provides rigorous development of the key concepts and results of real analysis. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp The topics include  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Real numbers.&nbsp;   Metric spaces. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Sequences: convergence, limsup and liminf, Cauchy sequences, sequences in metric spaces. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Infinite series: convergence, convergence tests, power series. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp Functions of one real variable: <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp limit and continuity,  properties of continuous functions, uniform continuity, <br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp  differentiation, integration, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp The course is focused on theory rather than computations. The students will learn and write proofs.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp Mathematical exposition will be emphasized. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp <i>Prerequisites:</i>&nbsp; Math 141 (required),  and Math 311M or Math 311W (strongly recommended).
